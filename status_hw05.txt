Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?

Rayyan Abdi

2. What hostname did you deploy to?

hw05.measuringworm.com

3. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

I had the most trouble with setting up socket.js and recognizing the 
connection between it and the channel. Also determining the order
of when the server sends state and when the callback should be
issued caused a misunderstanding. Playing with the example code
was a big help.

4. What part of your application state is on the server?

The answer, and the client game state.

5. What part of your application state, if any, is in the browser?

The client game state object which consists of: the input field value,
guess history, has the game been won, has the game been lost, 
and a user message for feedback.
